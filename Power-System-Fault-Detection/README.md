# Power-System-Fault-Detection
This project utilizes IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI to create and launch a machine learning solution that detects and identifies issues in power systems by analyzing voltage and current phasor inputs. The approach streamlines tasks like data handling, model building, and online deployment on IBM Cloud, supporting live fault identification through a RESTful API.

1. Core Capabilities
Input Data: Leverages electrical network sensor data, specifically voltage and current measurements, tagged with corresponding fault categories.

Automated AI Pipeline: Uses IBM Watsonx.ai’s AutoAI platform to fully automate model selection, parameter optimization, and data transformation.

Fault Recognition: Effectively categorizes various fault scenarios—including equipment overheating, conductor disconnection, and transformer malfunction—alongside healthy operational states.

Cloud-based API Deployment: Models are published as accessible REST API services via IBM Watson Machine Learning Lite, enabling real-time or scheduled predictions.

Scalable Architecture: Entire system runs on IBM Cloud, supporting seamless scaling, remote access, and reproducibility for testing and future improvements.

2. Practical Applications
Smart grid supervision and anomaly detection

Predictive maintenance for utility networks

Reduction of downtime through fast and accurate fault reporting

Support for energy companies in operational automation
